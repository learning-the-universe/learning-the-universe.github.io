### Description

The BORG (Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies) group uses Bayesian techniques coupled with fast dark matter forward models and flexible galaxy models to infer the cosmological initial conditions based on present day galaxy redshift catalogs and other data.

The core idea of what we are trying to achieve is summarized by the following figure:
