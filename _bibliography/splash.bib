      year = {2025},
      note = {in preparation},
      abstract = {We analyze the dust attenuation curves of ∼6000 galaxies from the IllustrisTNG50 & TNG100 simulations, considering 51 lines of sight per galaxy in the radiative transfer post-processing. We fit the curves with a versatile parametric model that reproduces various known extinction and attenuation curves. We identify strong correlations between attenuation curve parameters and intrinsic galaxy properties, enabling predictions of median dust attenuation curves based on $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and/or $A_V$, which align well with observational data. The resulting PDFs and scaling relations can be used as priors in inference studies, such as those conducted within the Learning the Universe (LtU) project, and for SED fitting applications.},

  abstract = {We introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a novel deep learning framework for reconstructing 3D cosmic initial conditions using non-differentiable structure formation models. Our method accurately recovers evolved dark matter and halo overdensity fields, demonstrating feasibility for field-level inference in cosmological analyses.},

  year = {2025},
  note = {in preparation},
  abstract = {We develop the Model-Insensitive Estimator (Miest), a machine learning framework that robustly estimates the cosmological parameters Ωm and σ8 from neutral hydrogen maps across multiple simulation models in the CAMELS project. By extracting only common features and disregarding model-specific variations, Miest improves predictive performance on unseen simulations by ∼17% for Ωm and 38% for σ8, enabling more reliable cosmological inference.},

The emulator accurately reproduces key summary statistics, including power spectra and bispectra, while achieving a thousandfold speedup over traditional N-body simulations, making it a valuable tool for large-scale cosmological inference.},

We then test and compare this to the heuristic IllustrisTNG and SH models, using isolated galaxies and cosmological zoom simulations. In passing, we also introduce a new "multi zoom-in" initial conditions code.}
