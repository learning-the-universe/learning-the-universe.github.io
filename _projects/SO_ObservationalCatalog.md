We are developing a Python package to showcase our observational data catalog and facilitate direct comparison between simulated and observed galaxy properties. The package allows users to easily download, explore, and visualize a curated set of observational relations—including stellar mass functions, size–mass relations, gas fractions, and more—organized using a “traffic light” system that reflects the reliability of each dataset (green = robust, red = uncertain).

The catalog currently focuses on $$z=0$$, and we are actively working on high-redshift extensions and incorporating additional observables. This tool is designed to support calibration, validation, and interpretation of simulations within the LTU framework and beyond.
