We have carried out radiative transfer post-processing on the IllustrisTNG50 simulation in order to study and characterize the impact of dust attenuation on galaxy SEDs. We have created a parameterized physics-based analytic model for dust attenuation informed by these results, which has been incorporated into the mock photometry pipeline and will form the basis of a publication to be submitted in the early Fall 2024. We are exploring how well we can constrain the parameters of the dust model using our general purpose LtU Implicit Likelihood Inference pipeline, as well as the impact of marginalizing over dust parameters when constraining cosmological parameters.
