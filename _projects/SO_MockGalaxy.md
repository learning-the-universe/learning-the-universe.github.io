We have constructed an efficient, flexible pipeline to compute synthetic galaxy spectral energy distributions (SED) and broad band photometry from simulated star formation histories (https://github.com/flaresimulations/synthesizer). This tool has been applied to several thousand of the CAMELS hydro simulations and the mock photometry is providing a valuable data product for project development.

Additionally, we have built tools to extract SDSS-like mock lightcones from standard cubical simulation boxes, and compiled a curated database of observations that can be used to calibrate and validate our new simulation suites.
