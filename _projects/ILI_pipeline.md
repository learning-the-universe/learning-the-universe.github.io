A key new innovation is the completion of a state-of-the-art analysis pipeline implementing Implicit Inference for the Learning the Universe collaboration, the LtU-ILI framework {% cite 2024arXiv240205137H %}. LtU-ILI is a highly configurable and user-friendly software package that makes multiple techniques for simulation-based inference accessible to the community. This framework allows for the direct comparison of different methods on test problems, facilitating the adoption and advancement of these techniques. The publication of LtU-ILI represents a key milestone in our efforts to democratize simulation-based inference in cosmology and has already found use in the wider community.
