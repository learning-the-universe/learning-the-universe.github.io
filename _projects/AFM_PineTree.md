The PineTree galaxy emulator {% cite Ding:2024 %} builds on previous work (% cite Charnock_2020 %} to predict galaxy clustering and lensing observables, exploiting the cosmological scale hierarchy to accurately capture non-linear information while maintaining computational efficiency. PineTree is built to have an extremely low parameter count that can be inferred from the data themselves. By leveraging these and more accurate models currently under development, our pipeline can scale to the large data volumes anticipated from upcoming surveys like DESI and Rubin LSST.
