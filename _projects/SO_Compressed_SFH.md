We developed and validated a technique to compress simulated star formation histories, which enables a factor of several hundred reduction in data volume while retaining acceptable precision in the target photometric quantities. This proved essential in order to store star formation histories for our test suite of thousands of larger volume ((150/h)$$^3$$) CAMELS-SAM semi-analytic simulations.
